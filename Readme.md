## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use IoTPulse, ensure you have the following:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- An IoT device capable of sending data via MQTT or HTTP
- Basic knowledge of IoT protocols and APIs
- (Optional) A server or cloud environment for self-hosted deployments (e.g., Docker, AWS, Azure)

### Installation

IoTPulse can be used as a cloud service or self-hosted. Below are the steps for a self-hosted setup.

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iotpulse.git
cd iotpulse
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Node.js and Docker installed, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Configure Environment

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the necessary configuration (e.g., database, MQTT broker, API keys):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

#### 4. Run the Application

Start the IoTPulse server using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### 5. Access the Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or your configured URL).

For cloud-based usage, sign up at [IoTPulse Cloud](https://iotpulse.example.com) and follow the onboarding guide.

## Usage

### Device Onboarding

1. Log in to the IoTPulse dashboard using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Devices" section and click "Add Device."
3. Follow the onboarding wizard to generate a unique link and token for your device.
4. Copy the provided template code, which includes the URL and token, and paste it into your device's firmware.
5. (Optional) Customize the template code to suit your device's requirements.

### Data Publishing

IoTPulse supports MQTT and HTTP protocols for data publishing:

- **MQTT**: Configure your device to publish data to the provided MQTT broker URL and topic.
- **HTTP**: Send data to the provided REST API endpoint using the token for authentication.

Example MQTT configuration:

```json
{
  "broker": "mqtt://iotpulse.example.com",
  "topic": "device/telemetry",
  "token": "your-device-token"
}
```

### Dashboard Customization

1. Create custom dashboards by selecting devices and widgets from the dashboard editor.
2. Sort devices by status (e.g., connected, live) or other criteria.
3. Add live charts, historical data views, or alerts to your dashboard.
4. Customize the theme and layout in the "Settings" section.

## API Integration

IoTPulse provides a RESTful API for developers to integrate with their applications. Key features include:

- Create and manage devices programmatically.
- Retrieve real-time and historical data.
- Configure alerts and notifications.

To get started, generate an API key from the dashboard's "API" section and refer to the [API Documentation](https://docs.iotpulse.example.com).

Example API request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" https://iotpulse.example.com/api/devices
```
